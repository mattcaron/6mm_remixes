- The HISS and Arctic HISS models are aggregates of the models of the
  same name from Jabberwock. However, the HISS MK1 subdirectory is my
  aggregation of the more detailed chassis and treads from the Arctic
  HISS with the basket and blanket removed and the superset of all the
  turrets from both. This allows the user to mix and match turrets
  with the high quality model.
