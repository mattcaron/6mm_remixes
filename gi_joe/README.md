This directory contains 1:285 combinations and recscales for a variety
of G.I. Joe vehicles originally in action figure scales by Jabberwock
and HammSammich. The originals are here:

According to:

https://www.actionfigurefury.com/action-figure-scales/

G.I. Joe figures are supposedly 1:18. To get to 1:285, we scale to
6.3% of the original model size (1/18 = 0.0556 * 0.063 = 0.0035; 1/285
= 0.0035). I checked some of the models against real world models and
they seemed a little small - plus, the scale is "about 1:18". So, I
scaled them to 10% of figure scale, which looked about right. If
they're too large for your taste, 63% of their current scale should
get you to "true" scale.

Note that I put the MOBAT next to what was supposedly a correct scale
MBT-70 (upon which it was based) and it is *slightly* larger - 90% is
about the correct scale. At the current scale (10% of action figure
scale) it's about the size of an M1A1 Abrams, which is, honestly,
quite fine. G.I. Joe is supposed to be larger than life anyway.
