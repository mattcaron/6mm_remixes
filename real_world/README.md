This directory contains 1:285 rescales for a variety of modern
real-world vehicles. The originals are here:

For 1:100 originals, they were scaled to 35% (1/100 = 0.01 * 0.35 =
0.0035; 1/285 = 0.0035)

For 1:200 originals, they were scaled to 70% (1/200 = 0.005 * 0.70 =
0.0035; 1/285 = 0.0035).

I took the liberty of roughly organizing them by country of origin. I
say roughly because licensed copies of various tanks were manufactured
in various countries.
